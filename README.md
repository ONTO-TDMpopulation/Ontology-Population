# Ontology-Population

This repository contains dataset, ontology and python scripts for ONTO-TDM (Ontology for Teaching Domain Modeling) population.

## Dataset

The dataset used for testing the script is located in the dataset directory "https://github.com/ONTO-TDMpopulation/Ontology-Population/tree/main/Dataset". It consists of texts collected from a variety of sources, including Wikipedia, online articles, specialized websites related to algorithms and data structures discipline. The dataset covers both foundational and advanced concepts comprehensively from this domain. Each file in this directory has a .txt extension. The dataset comprises diverse textual documents, which are processed to extract important phrases.

## Ontology
The ontology used is based on the core ontology ONTO-TDM specifically designed to represent and describe a discipline, focusing on its
application in learning-by-doing scenarios. The primary aim of this ontology is to provide a comprehensive framework that captures the essential elements of a discipline, including its
concepts, relationships, functions, and rules.
The resulting ontology can be found in the ontology directory "https://github.com/ONTO-TDMpopulation/Ontology-Population/tree/main/Ontology".

## Code
The code has been temporarily removed. However, it remains available upon request for research purposes.
