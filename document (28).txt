A binary expression tree is a specific kind of a binary tree used to represent expressions. Two common types of expressions that a binary expression tree can represent are algebraic and boolean.  These trees can represent expressions that contain both unary and binary operators. following are the properties of a binary expression tree:

The operands are always represented by the leaf nodes. These operands are always used in the operations.
The operator at the root of the tree is always given top priority.
When compared to the operators at the bottom of the tree, the operator at the bottom is always given the lowest priority.
Because the operand is always present at a depth of the tree, it is given the highest priority of all operators.
The expression tree can be traversed to evaluate prefix expressions, postfix expressions, and infix expressions.

Like any binary tree, each node of a binary expression tree has zero, one, or two children. This restricted structure simplifies the processing of expression trees.

Algebraic expression trees represent expressions that contain numbers, variables, and unary and binary operators. The operators are contained in the internal nodes of the tree, with the numbers and variables in the leaf nodes. The nodes of binary operators have two child nodes, and the unary operators have one child node.

Boolean expressions are represented very similarly to algebraic expressions, the only difference being the specific values and operators used. Boolean expressions use true and false as constant values, and the operators include (AND), (OR), and (NOT).
