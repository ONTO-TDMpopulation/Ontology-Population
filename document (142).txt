A 2-3-4 tree is a self-balancing tree. The number represents the number of children each node can have. Any internal node can have either two, three, or four child nodes. It is also called a 2-4 tree.

Properties of a 2-3-4 Tree:
A 2-node has one data element and if it is an internal node, then it has two child nodes.
A 3-node has two data elements and if this is an internal node, it has three child nodes.
A 4-node has three data elements and if it is an internal node, it has four child nodes.
The elements in each node should be sorted from smallest to greatest.
2-3-4 tree is a perfectly balanced tree i.e., in this all leaf nodes are at the same level.
The type of any node is decided based on the structure of the tree (the structure gets decided such that the tree is always a perfectly balanced tree).

There are three basic operations that are performed in a 2-3-4 tree. The operations are:

Insertion of a node: In insertion operation, a node is inserted in the proper location in the tree. The insertion operation is always performed in a leaf node. If there are empty spaces in the internal nodes also, still we do not use them for insertion. 

Searching a value: The searching operation is similar to a binary search tree. 

Deletion of a node: the deletion operation is performed always on the leaf.
