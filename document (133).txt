A non-linear data structure is another important type in which data elements are not arranged sequentially; mainly, data elements are arranged in random order without forming a linear structure.

Data elements are present at the multilevel, for example, tree.

In trees, the data elements are arranged in the hierarchical form, whereas in graphs, the data elements are arranged in random order, using the edges and vertex.

Multiple runs are required to traverse through all the elements completely. Traversing in a single run is impossible to traverse the whole data structure.

Each element can have multiple paths to reach another element.

Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure.

The data structure where data items are not organized sequentially is called a non-linear data structure. In other words, data elements of the non-linear data structure could be connected to more than one element to reflect a special relationship among them.
