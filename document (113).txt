In data structures, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are commonly used for storing and manipulating textual data in computer programs. They can be manipulated using various operations like concatenation, substring extraction, and comparison.

Strings support a wide range of operations, including concatenation, substring extraction, length calculation, and more. These operations allow developers to manipulate and process string data efficiently.

Below are fundamental operations commonly performed on strings in programming.

Concatenation: Combining two strings to create a new string.
Length: Determining the number of characters in a string.
Access: Accessing individual characters in a string by index.
Substring: Extracting a portion of a string.
Comparison: Comparing two strings to check for equality or order.
Search: Finding the position of a specific substring within a string.
Modification: Changing or replacing characters within a string.

below are the a	applications of strings:

Text Processing: Strings are extensively used for text processing tasks such as searching, manipulating, and analyzing textual data.

Data Representation: Strings are fundamental for representing and manipulating data in formats like JSON, XML, and CSV.

Encryption and Hashing: Strings are commonly used in encryption and hashing algorithms to secure sensitive data and ensure data integrity.

Database Operations: Strings are essential for working with databases, including storing and querying text-based data.

Web Development: Strings are utilized in web development for constructing URLs, handling form data, processing input from web forms, and generating dynamic content.
