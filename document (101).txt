R-tree is a tree data structure used for storing spatial data indexes in an efficient manner. R-trees are highly useful for spatial data queries and storage. Some of the real-life applications are: 

Indexing multi-dimensional information.
Handling geospatial coordinates.
Implementation of virtual maps.
Handling game data.
