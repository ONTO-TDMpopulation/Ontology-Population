A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value. Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

There are two main types of heaps:
Max Heap: The root node contains the maximum value, and the values decrease as you move down the tree.
Min Heap: The root node contains the minimum value, and the values increase as you move down the tree.

Common heap operations are:
Insert: Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
Extract Max/Min: Removes the maximum or minimum element from the heap and returns it.
Heapify: Converts an arbitrary binary tree into a heap.
replace: pop root and push a new key. This is more efficient than a pop followed by a push, since it only needs to balance once, not twice, and is appropriate for fixed-size heaps.
merge (union): joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both, preserving the original heaps.
meld: joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both, destroying the original heaps.
size: return the number of items in the heap.
is-empty: return true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.
increase-key or decrease-key: updating a key within a max- or min-heap, respectively
delete: delete an arbitrary node (followed by moving last node and sifting to maintain heap)
sift-up: move a node up in the tree, as long as needed; used to restore heap condition after insertion. Called "sift" because node moves up the tree until it reaches the correct level, as in a sieve.
sift-down: move a node down in the tree, similar to sift-up; used to restore heap condition after deletion or replacement.

Heaps have various applications, like:

Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements are retrieved based on their priority (maximum or minimum value).
Heapsort is a sorting algorithm that uses a heap to sort an array in ascending or descending order.
Heaps are used in graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm and Prim’s algorithm for finding the shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.
