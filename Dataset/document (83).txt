Merkle Trees, or Hash Trees, is a construct used for generating hashes of large amounts of data. This works whether itâ€™s a single large file, a lot of small files, or any scenario where we have a significant amount of data.

A Merkle Tree is a tree of hash values. The end result of this is a tree structure in which every intermediate node is a hash of its child nodes until the leaf nodes of the tree are actually hashes of the original data. This means every leaf node is a hash of only a small portion of the data.

These data structures have two major purposes:

Efficiently verifying that a large amount of data is unchanged and finding exactly where any changes may have occurred
Efficiently proving that a piece of data is present in a larger data set
