Splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree data structure, which means that the tree structure is adjusted dynamically based on the accessed or inserted elements. In other words, the tree automatically reorganizes itself so that frequently accessed or inserted elements become closer to the root node.

Operations in a splay tree:

Insertion: To insert a new element into the tree, start by performing a regular binary search tree insertion. Then, apply rotations to bring the newly inserted element to the root of the tree.

Deletion: To delete an element from the tree, first locate it using a binary search tree search. Then, if the element has no children, simply remove it. If it has one child, promote that child to its position in the tree. If it has two children, find the successor of the element (the smallest element in its right subtree), swap its key with the element to be deleted, and delete the successor instead. There are two types of deletions in the splay trees: Bottom-up splaying and Top-down splaying.

Search: To search for an element in the tree, start by performing a binary search tree search. If the element is found, apply rotations to bring it to the root of the tree. If it is not found, apply rotations to the last node visited in the search, which becomes the new root.

Splaying: a process to bring an operational node to the root. 

Rotation: The rotations used in a splay tree are either a Zig or a Zig-Zig rotation. A Zig rotation is used to bring a node to the root, while a Zig-Zig rotation is used to balance the tree after multiple accesses to elements in the same subtree.

Zig Rotation: The Zig Rotation in splay trees operates in a manner similar to the single right rotation in AVL Tree rotations. This rotation results in nodes moving one position to the right from their current location. 

Zag Rotation: The Zag Rotation in splay trees operates in a similar fashion to the single left rotation in AVL Tree rotations. During this rotation, nodes shift one position to the left from their current location.

Zig-Zig Rotation: The Zig-Zig Rotation in splay trees is a double zig rotation. This rotation results in nodes shifting two positions to the right from their current location.

Zag-Zag Rotation: In splay trees, the Zag-Zag Rotation is a double zag rotation. This rotation causes nodes to move two positions to the left from their present position.

Zig-Zag Rotation: The Zig-Zag Rotation in splay trees is a combination of a zig rotation followed by a zag rotation. As a result of this rotation, nodes shift one position to the right and then one position to the left from their current location. 

Zag-Zig Rotation: The Zag-Zig Rotation in splay trees is a series of zag rotations followed by a zig rotation. This results in nodes moving one position to the left, followed by a shift one position to the right from their current location.
