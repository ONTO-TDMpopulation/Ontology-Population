In computer science, the Boolean (sometimes shortened to Bool) is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century. The Boolean data type is primarily associated with conditional statements, which allow different actions by changing control flow depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean condition evaluates to true or false. 

It is a special case of a more general logical data typeâ€”logic does not always need to be Boolean. The purpose of boolean values is to represent binary test conditions and decisions in a program. The two conditions are essential concepts in programming, algorithms, control structures, data structures, and logical operations. The main difference between booleans, text, and numbers is: The boolean data type has two values to represent a logical state.

A text is any character or string-type data. Numbers are numerical values. All three datatypes are implemented differently and have different available operations. However, every programming language implements the context of true and false values. Text and number values can have a boolean context; such expressions are considered truthy or falsy. Specific rules for evaluating an expression's value in a boolean context vary between programming languages.
