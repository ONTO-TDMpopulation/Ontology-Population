AA tree is a form of balanced tree used for storing and retrieving ordered data efficiently. AA trees are named after Arne Andersson, the one who theorized them. AA trees are a variation of the red–black tree, a form of binary search tree which supports efficient addition and deletion of entries. Unlike red–black trees, red nodes on an AA tree can only be added as a right subchild. In other words, no red node can be a left sub-child.  This results in the simulation of a 2–3 tree instead of a 2–3–4 tree, which greatly simplifies the maintenance operations. 

The maintenance algorithms for a red–black tree need to consider seven different shapes to properly balance the tree: An AA tree on the other hand only needs to consider two shapes due to the strict requirement that only right links can be red: AA trees require O(log(log(N))) bits of metadata per node, in the form of an integer "level".  The following invariants hold for AA trees: The level of every leaf node is one. The level of every left child is exactly one less than that of its parent. The level of every right child is equal to or one less than that of its parent. The level of every right grandchild is strictly less than that of its grandparent.

Insertions and deletions may transiently cause an AA tree to become unbalanced (that is, to violate the AA tree invariants).  Only two distinct operations are needed for restoring balance: "skew" and "split". Skew is a right rotation to replace a subtree containing a left horizontal link with one containing a right horizontal link instead. Split is a left rotation and level increase to replace a subtree containing two or more consecutive right horizontal links with one containing two fewer consecutive right horizontal links.  Implementation of balance-preserving insertion and deletion is simplified by relying on the skew and split operations to modify the tree only if needed, instead of making their callers decide whether to skew or split. As in most balanced binary trees, the deletion of an internal node can be turned into the deletion of a leaf node by swapping the internal node with either its closest predecessor or successor, depending on which are in the tree or on the implementor's whims.  Retrieving a predecessor is simply a matter of following one left link and then all of the remaining right links.  Similarly, the successor can be found by going right once and left until a null pointer is found.  Because of the AA property of all nodes of level greater than one having two children, the successor or predecessor node will be in level 1, making their removal trivial. 

AA trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree that are similar to red-black trees, but use a different algorithm for balancing. They are designed to provide efficient operations for inserting, deleting, and searching key-value pairs, making them useful for a variety of applications in computer science. 

Here are some of the different operations that can be performed on AA trees: 
aa tree Searching: means that AA trees are designed for efficient searching of key-value pairs. When searching for a specific key in an AA tree, the search algorithm starts at the root of the tree and traverses the tree based on the values of the keys until the desired key is found. 

Key-value insertion: includes when a new key-value pair is added to an AA tree, the tree is reorganized to maintain its balance and ensure that it remains a valid AA tree. The new key-value pair is inserted into a leaf node, and if the leaf node becomes unbalanced, the tree is rebalanced using specific rotations and other algorithms. 

Key-value deletion: includes When a key-value pair is deleted from an AA tree, the tree is also reorganized to maintain its balance and validity. If the key-value pair is in a leaf node, it is simply removed. If the key-value pair is in an internal node, the node is either merged with a sibling node or redistributed to other nodes, with balancing applied as necessary. 

aa tree Traversing: can be traversed in several ways, including inorder, preorder, and postorder. Inorder traversal of an AA tree returns the keys in sorted order, making it useful for range queries and data analysis. 

aa tree Splitting and merging: are designed to maintain their balance by splitting and merging nodes as necessary. When a node becomes unbalanced, it is rotated and rebalanced to maintain its validity. 
Overall, the different operations of AA trees are critical for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs in a variety of applications, including databases, file systems, and search engines. Understanding the intricacies of AA tree operations and algorithms is important for anyone working in these and other related fields.
