Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a popular algorithms for solving many single-source shortest path problems having non-negative edge weight in the graphs i.e., it is to find the shortest distance between two vertices on a graph. It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.

Dijkstra's algorithm is used for solving single-source shortest path problems for directed or undirected paths. Single-source means that one vertex is chosen to be the start, and the algorithm will find the shortest path from that vertex to all other vertices.

Dijkstra's algorithm does not work for graphs with negative edges. For graphs with negative edges, the Bellman-Ford algorithm that is described on the next page, can be used instead.

To find the shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm needs to know which vertex is the source, it needs a way to mark vertices as visited, and it needs an overview of the current shortest distance to each vertex as it works its way through the graph, updating these distances when a shorter distance is found.
