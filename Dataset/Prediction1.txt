In computer science, a WAVL tree or weak AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. WAVL trees are named after AVL trees, another type of balanced search tree, and are closely related both to AVL trees and red–black trees, which all fall into a common framework of rank balanced trees.
Like other balanced binary search trees, WAVL trees can handle insertion, deletion, and search operations in time O(log n) per operation.WAVL trees are designed to combine some of the best properties of both AVL trees and red–black trees.
