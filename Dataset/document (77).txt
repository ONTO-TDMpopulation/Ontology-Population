A link-cut tree is a data structure for representing a forest, a set of rooted trees, and offers the following operations:

Add a tree consisting of a single node to the forest.
Given a node in one of the trees, disconnect it (and its subtree) from the tree of which it is part.
Attach a node to another node as its child.
Given a node, find the root of the tree to which it belongs. By doing this operation on two distinct nodes, one can check whether they belong to the same tree.

The basic operations that can be performed on an Link-cut tree include:

Link(u, v): This operation creates a new edge between two nodes u and v, making u the parent of v.
Cut(u, v): This operation removes the edge between two nodes u and v, disconnecting v from its parent u.
Find-root(u): This operation finds the root of the tree that contains the node u.
Access(u): This operation returns the value associated with the node u, and also updates all the necessary tree information.

Link Cut Trees is a powerful data structure that allows for the efficient manipulation of trees. It is based on a set of nodes and pointers linking them together. It supports basic operations like link, cut, find-root, and access, but itâ€™s a bit more complex than that, and a library or a pre-built class is recommended to use.
