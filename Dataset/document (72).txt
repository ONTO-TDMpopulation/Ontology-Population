Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted array one element at a time. It is considered an “in-place” sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn’t require any additional memory space beyond the original array.

Advantages of Insertion Sort:
Simple and easy to implement.
Stable sorting algorithm.
Efficient for small lists and nearly sorted lists.
Space-efficient.

Disadvantages of Insertion Sort:
Inefficient for large lists.
Not as efficient as other sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort) for most cases.


Insertion sort is commonly used in situations where:
The list is small or nearly sorted.
Simplicity and stability are important.
