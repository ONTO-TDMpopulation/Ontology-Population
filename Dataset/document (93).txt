Conditional statements in Programming, also known as decision-making statements, allow a program to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. They form the backbone of most programming languages, enabling the creation of complex, dynamic programs.

Conditional statements in programming allow the execution of different pieces of code based on whether certain conditions are true or false. Here are five common types of conditional statements:

If Conditional Statement: The if statement is the most basic form of conditional statement. It checks if a condition is true. If it is, the program executes a block of code.

If-Else Conditional Statement: The if-else statement extends the if statement by adding an else clause. If the condition is false, the program executes the code in the else block.

if-Else if Conditional Statement: The if-else if statement allows for multiple conditions to be checked in sequence. If the if condition is false, the program checks the next else if condition, and so on.

Switch Conditional Statement: The switch statement is used when you need to check a variable against a series of values. Itâ€™s often used as a more readable alternative to a long if-else if chain. In switch expressions, each block is terminated by a break keyword. The statements in switch are expressed with cases.

Ternary Expression Conditional Statement: The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It takes three operands: a condition, a result for when the condition is true, and a result for when the condition is false.
