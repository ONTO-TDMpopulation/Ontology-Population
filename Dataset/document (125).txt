Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) are a fundamental concept in graph theory and algorithms. In a directed graph, a Strongly Connected Component is a subset of vertices where every vertex in the subset is reachable from every other vertex in the same subset by traversing the directed edges. Finding the SCCs of a graph can provide important insights into the structure and connectivity of the graph, with applications in various fields such as social network analysis, web crawling, and network routing.
