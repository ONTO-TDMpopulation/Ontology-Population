In computer science, an identifier is a name given to a programming language entity such as a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item. Identifiers are used to uniquely identify these entities within a program. Some of the kinds of entities an identifier might denote include variables, data types, labels, subroutines, and modules.

Identifiers are typically composed of letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits, and underscores.
Identifiers usually cannot start with a digit.

Identifiers are case-sensitive in most programming languages, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered distinct.

Identifiers should be chosen to be meaningful and descriptive to make the code more readable and maintainable.

Identifiers should not be the same as keywords or reserved words in the programming language.
