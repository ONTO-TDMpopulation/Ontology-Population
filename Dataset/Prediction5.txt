Dynamic programming algorithm is an optimization technique used in computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. 

This technique is especially useful for problems that involve a large number of overlapping subproblems, where a brute force approach would be computationally expensive. Dynamic programming algorithms typically involve solving a series of smaller subproblems in a recursive manner and building up the solutions to larger subproblems from the solutions to smaller ones. As an example, consider the problem of computing the Fibonacci sequence, which is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem. 

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including problems in graph theory, bioinformatics, and optimization. However, it can also be a challenging technique to master, as it requires careful analysis of the problem at hand and the ability to identify overlapping subproblems. With practice and experience, however, dynamic programming can be a valuable tool for solving complex problems efficiently.
