A file is a collection of related records.

In the context of databases, a file corresponds to a table where each row is a record and each column is a field.

The structure of a file is defined in its file specification or schema, which includes the names of fields, their order, and their data types.

Files can be sequential files, where records must be accessed in the same order they were added, or random access files, where records can be accessed in any order.

Files can also be indexed, meaning they have an index that allows quick access to any record, similar to the index of a book.

Text files store data in human-readable form, while binary files store data in a format that can only be read by a computer.

Files are stored on a permanent storage medium, such as a hard disk, which allows data to be retained even when the computer is turned off.
