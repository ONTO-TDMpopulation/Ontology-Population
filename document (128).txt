A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected.

Following are a few properties of the spanning tree connected to a graph:

A connected graph G can have more than one spanning tree.

All possible spanning trees of graph G, have the same number of edges and vertices.

The spanning tree does not have any cycle (loops).

Removing one edge from the spanning tree will make the graph disconnected, i.e. the spanning tree is minimally connected.

Adding one edge to the spanning tree will create a circuit or loop, i.e. the spanning tree is maximally acyclic.

Spanning tree is basically used to find a minimum path to connect all nodes in a graph. Common application of spanning trees are:
Civil Network Planning.
Computer Network Routing Protocol.
Cluster Analysis.
