Pigeonhole sorting is a sorting algorithm that is suitable for sorting lists of elements where the number of elements and the number of possible key values are approximately the same. It is similar tocounting sort, but diﬀers inthat it moves items twice:once to the bucket array andagain to the ﬁnal destination counting sort builds an auxiliary array then uses the array tocompute each item's ﬁnal destination and move the item there.
