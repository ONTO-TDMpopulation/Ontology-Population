A stack is a linear data structure that follows a last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. The main operations that can be performed on a stack include:

Push operation: adds an item to the top of the stack. It takes constant time O(1) on average.

Pop operation: removes the item at the top of the stack. It takes constant time O(1) on average.

Peek operation: returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it. It takes constant time O(1).

Size operation: returns the number of items in the stack. It takes constant time O(1).

Empty operation: returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack is empty or not. It takes constant time O(1).

Stacks are commonly used in computer science applications, such as implementing recursive algorithms, parsing expressions, and managing function calls and local variables during program execution.

When an item is pushed onto a stack, it becomes the new top item, and any subsequent push operations will add new items above it. When an item is popped from the stack, the item at the top becomes the new top item, and any subsequent pop operations will remove items from the top of the stack.

Stacks can also be implemented using an array or a linked list. Using an array provides constant time access to any item in the stack, while using a linked list provides dynamic memory allocation and efficient memory management.

Overall, stacks are simple yet powerful data structures that provide an efficient and organized way to manage and manipulate data.
