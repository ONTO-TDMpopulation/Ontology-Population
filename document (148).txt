Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity.

It is the amount of memory needed for the completion of an algorithm. 

To estimate the memory requirement we need to focus on two parts: 
A fixed part: It is independent of the input size. It includes memory for instructions (code), constants, variables, etc.
A variable part: It is dependent on the input size. It includes memory for recursion stack, referenced variables, etc.
