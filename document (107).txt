In computer science, a soft heap is a variant on the simple heap data structure that has constant amortized time complexity for five types of operations. This is achieved by carefully "corrupting" (increasing) the keys of at most a constant number of values in the heap.

The constant time operations are:

Creation: Create a new soft heap.
Insertion: Insert an element into a soft heap.
concatenation: Combine the contents of two soft heaps into one, destroying both.
Deletion: Delete an element from a soft heap.
Finding Minimum: Get the element with minimum key in the soft heap.
