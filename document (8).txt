Undirected graphs are graphs where edges have no specific direction, and they represent relationships or connections between entities. Here are some common operations that can be performed on undirected graphs:

Vertex Addition: Adding a vertex involves introducing a new node to the graph.

Edge Addition: Adding an edge connects two vertices in the graph, representing a relationship or connection between them. In undirected graphs, the edges are bidirectional.

Vertex Deletion: Removing a vertex eliminates it from the graph, along with any associated edges.

Edge Deletion: Removing an edge disconnects two vertices, removing the relationship between them.

Graph Traversal: Traversing an undirected graph involves visiting all vertices or a subset of vertices in a specific order. Common graph traversal algorithms include depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

Path Finding: Finding a path between two vertices determines if there exists a sequence of edges that connect them. Algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, or A* search can be used for path finding.

Connected Components: Identifying connected components partitions the graph into subsets where all vertices in each subset are connected to each other. This helps analyze the connectivity of the graph.

Cycle Detection: Detecting cycles in an undirected graph determines if there are any closed loops or cycles present. Algorithms like DFS or Union-Find can be used for cycle detection.

Minimum Spanning Tree: Finding the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph identifies a subset of edges that form a tree connecting all vertices with the minimum possible total weight. Common algorithms for this include Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.

Graph Coloring: Assigning colors to vertices of an undirected graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Graph coloring has applications in scheduling, register allocation, and graph theory.

Graph Matching: Determining if two graphs are isomorphic, meaning they have the same structure but may have different vertex labels.

These operations provide a foundation for analyzing and manipulating undirected graphs. Depending on the specific context and requirements, there are many more operations and algorithms available for working with undirected graphs.
