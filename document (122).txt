Amortized analysis is a method used to analyze the performance of algorithms that perform a sequence of operations, where each individual operation may be fast, but the sequence of operations may be slow as a whole. It is used to determine the average cost per operation, allowing for a more accurate comparison of algorithms that perform different numbers of operations.

The accounting method of amortized analysis can be useful for understanding the performance of algorithms that perform a sequence of operations with varying costs. It can be applied to a wide range of data structures and algorithms.
